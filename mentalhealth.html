                        <p class="lead">What is depression?
                            Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease your ability to function at work and at home.
                            Depression Is Different From Sadness or Grief/Bereavement
                            The death of a loved one, loss of a job or the ending of a relationship are difficult experiences for a person to endure. It is normal for feelings of sadness or grief to develop in response to such situations. Those experiencing loss often might describe themselves as being “depressed.”
                            But being sad is not the same as having depression. The grieving process is natural and unique to each individual and shares some of the same features of depression. Both grief and depression may involve intense sadness and withdrawal from usual activities.

                            Feeling sad or having a depressed mood
                            Loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed
                            Changes in appetite — weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting
                            Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much
                            Loss of energy or increased fatigue
                            Increase in purposeless physical activity (e.g., inability to sit still, pacing, handwringing) or slowed movements or speech (these actions must be severe enough to be observable by others)
                            Feeling worthless or guilty
                            Difficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions
                            Thoughts of death or suicide
                            Symptoms must last at least two weeks and must represent a change in your previous level of functioning for a diagnosis of depression.
Depression affects an estimated one in 15 adults (6.7%) in any given year. And one in six people (16.6%) will experience depression at some time in their life. Depression can occur at any time, but on average, first appears during the late teens to mid-20s. Women are more likely than men to experience depression. Some studies show that one-third of women will experience a major depressive episode in their lifetime. There is a high degree of heritability when first-degree relatives have depression.

                            Genetics: Depression can run in families. For example, if one identical twin has depression, the other has a 70 percent chance of having the illness sometime in life.
                            Personality: People with low self-esteem, who are easily overwhelmed by stress, or who are generally pessimistic appear to be more likely to experience depression.
                            Environmental factors: Continuous exposure to violence, neglect, abuse or poverty may make some people more vulnerable to depression.

                            Before a diagnosis or treatment, a health professional should conduct a thorough diagnostic evaluation, including an interview and a physical examination. In some cases, a blood test might be done to make sure the depression is not due to a medical condition like a thyroid problem or a vitamin deficiency. The evaluation will identify specific symptoms and explore medical and family histories as well as cultural and environmental factors with the goal of arriving at a diagnosis and planning a course of action.

                        <p class="lead">Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that's triggered by a terrifying event — either experiencing it or witnessing it. Symptoms may include flashbacks, nightmares and severe anxiety, as well as uncontrollable thoughts about the event.
                            Most people who go through traumatic events may have temporary difficulty adjusting and coping, but with time and good self-care, they usually get better. If the symptoms get worse, last for months or even years, and interfere with your day-to-day functioning, you may have PTSD.
                            Getting effective treatment after PTSD symptoms develop can be critical to reduce symptoms and improve function.

                        <p class="lead">Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms may start within one month of a traumatic event, but sometimes symptoms may not appear until years after the event. These symptoms cause significant problems in social or work situations and in relationships. They can also interfere with your ability to go about your normal daily tasks.
                            PTSD symptoms are generally grouped into four types: intrusive memories, avoidance, negative changes in thinking and mood, and changes in physical and emotional reactions. Symptoms can vary over time or vary from person to person.
                            Intrusive memories:
                            Recurrent, unwanted distressing memories of the traumatic event
                            Reliving the traumatic event as if it were happening again (flashbacks)
                            Upsetting dreams or nightmares about the traumatic event
                            Severe emotional distress or physical reactions to something that reminds you of the traumatic event
                            Avoidance:
                            Trying to avoid thinking or talking about the traumatic event
                            Avoiding places, activities or people that remind you of the traumatic event

                        <p class="lead">After surviving a traumatic event, many people have PTSD-like symptoms at first, such as being unable to stop thinking about what's happened. Fear, anxiety, anger, depression, guilt — all are common reactions to trauma. However, the majority of people exposed to trauma do not develop long-term post-traumatic stress disorder.
                            Getting timely help and support may prevent normal stress reactions from getting worse and developing into PTSD. This may mean turning to family and friends who will listen and offer comfort. It may mean seeking out a mental health professional for a brief course of therapy. Some people may also find it helpful to turn to their faith community.
                            Support from others also may help prevent you from turning to unhealthy coping methods, such as misuse of alcohol or drugs.
                            Anxiety 
                            What is Anxiety?
                            Anxiety is a feeling of fear, dread, and uneasiness. It might cause you to sweat, feel restless and tense, and have a rapid heartbeat. It can be a normal reaction to stress. For example, you might feel anxious when faced with a difficult problem at work, before taking a test, or before making an important decision.
                            Anxiety is your body’s natural response to stress. It’s a feeling of fear or apprehension about what’s to come. But if your feelings of anxiety are extreme, last for longer than six months, and are interfering with your life, you may have an anxiety disorder.

                        <p class="lead"> Anxiety feels different depending on the person experiencing it. Feelings can range from butterflies in your stomach to a racing heart. You might feel out of control, like there’s a disconnect between your mind and body.

                            Other ways people experience anxiety include nightmares, panic attacks, and painful thoughts or memories that you can’t control. You may have a general feeling of fear and worry, or you may fear a specific place or event.
                            
                            Symptoms of general anxiety include:
                            increased heart rate
                            rapid breathing
                            Restlessness
                            trouble concentrating
                            difficulty falling asleep
                            Your anxiety symptoms might be totally different from someone else’s. That’s why it’s important to know all the ways anxiety can present itself. 
                            Common symptoms of an anxiety attack include:
                            feeling faint or dizzy
                            shortness of breath
                            dry mouth
                            sweating
                            chills or hot flashes
                            apprehension and worry
                            restlessness
                            distress
                            fear
                            numbness or tingling
                            A panic attack and an anxiety attack share some common symptoms, but they’re not the same.
